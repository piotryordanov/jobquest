name: jobquest-init
description: Use this skill automatically when the user first uses any jobquest skill and the configs/ directory doesn't exist yet. Sets up the configuration files (preferences.yaml, companies.yaml, job_boards.yaml) by asking the user for their preferences interactively.
---

# JobQuest Initialization

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- User tries to use any jobquest skill for the first time
- The `configs/` directory doesn't exist in the project root
- Any required config files are missing (preferences.yaml, companies.yaml, job_boards.yaml)

## Automatic Detection

Before running any other jobquest skill, check if configs exist:

```bash
# Check if configs directory exists
ls configs/preferences.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

If the file doesn't exist, invoke this skill first.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Welcome Message

Greet the user and explain what's happening:

```
Welcome to JobQuest! ðŸŽ¯

I'll help you set up your job search configuration. This will only take a minute.

I'll create:
- configs/preferences.yaml (your job search preferences)
- configs/companies.yaml (tracked companies)
- configs/job_boards.yaml (job boards you use)
```

### Step 2: Ask for Location Preferences

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather preferences:

```markdown
**Question:** Where are you looking for jobs?

**Options:**
1. Remote only
2. Specific cities (I'll ask which ones)
3. Both remote and specific cities
```

**If they choose specific cities**, ask for a comma-separated list:
```
Which cities? (e.g., "Dubai, London, Singapore")
```

### Step 3: Ask for Employment Type

```markdown
**Question:** What type of employment are you seeking?

**Options:**
1. Full-time only
2. Contract only
3. Both full-time and contract
4. Any type
```

### Step 4: Create configs/ Directory

```bash
mkdir -p configs
```

### Step 5: Generate preferences.yaml

Create `configs/preferences.yaml` based on their answers:

```yaml
# Job Search Preferences
# Auto-generated by JobQuest initialization

# Preferred job locations
locations:
  - "Remote"
  # Add user's specified cities

# Employment types
employment_types:
  - "Full-time"
  # Add user's preferences

# Optional: Uncomment and customize these
# min_salary: 150000
# currency: "USD"

# prioritize_keywords:
#   - "AI"
#   - "Senior"

# avoid_keywords:
#   - "Junior"
#   - "Intern"
```

### Step 6: Generate companies.yaml

Create `configs/companies.yaml` with empty starter:

```yaml
# Known Company Careers Pages
# This file is auto-populated as you search for jobs

companies: []
  # Companies will be added automatically as you discover them
  # You can also manually add companies here:
  #
  # - name: "Company Name"
  #   careers_url: "https://careers.company.com"
  #   platform: "lever"  # lever, greenhouse, ashby, generic
  #   added_date: "2025-10-23"
  #   last_searched: null
  #   notes: "Optional notes"
```

### Step 7: Generate job_boards.yaml

Create `configs/job_boards.yaml` with popular defaults:

```yaml
# Job Boards Reference
# Track which boards you use and their effectiveness

job_boards:
  - name: "RemoteOK"
    url: "https://remoteok.com/"
    category: "remote"
    effectiveness: null
    last_checked: null
    notes: "Popular remote job board"

  - name: "We Work Remotely"
    url: "https://weworkremotely.com/"
    category: "remote"
    effectiveness: null
    last_checked: null
    notes: "Remote-first companies"

  - name: "AngelList (Wellfound)"
    url: "https://wellfound.com/"
    category: "tech"
    effectiveness: null
    last_checked: null
    notes: "Startup-focused"

  # Add crypto/fintech boards if relevant
  # - name: "Cryptocurrency Jobs"
  #   url: "https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/"
  #   category: "crypto"
  #   effectiveness: null
  #   last_checked: null

  # You can add more boards here or Claude will help you add them as you discover them
```

### Step 8: Confirmation

After creating all files:

```markdown
âœ… Configuration complete!

Created:
- configs/preferences.yaml (locations: [list], employment: [types])
- configs/companies.yaml (ready to track companies)
- configs/job_boards.yaml (populated with popular boards)

You're all set! You can now:
- "Find jobs at [Company]"
- "Which jobs are relevant to me?"
- "Create a resume for [job]"

You can edit these config files anytime in the `configs/` directory.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be friendly and conversational** - This is the user's first interaction
2. **Explain what each file does** - Help them understand the system
3. **Use sensible defaults** - Remote + Full-time is common
4. **Make it quick** - Don't ask too many questions
5. **Confirm what was created** - Show them what happened

## Error Handling

**If configs/ already exists:**
- Don't re-run initialization
- Just confirm: "Configs already set up! Ready to search for jobs."

**If only some files are missing:**
- Create only the missing files
- Don't overwrite existing configs

**If user wants to reset:**
- Ask for confirmation: "This will overwrite your existing preferences. Continue?"

## Example Interaction

**User:** "Find jobs at Aktek"

**Claude (detects no configs):**

*Automatically invokes jobquest-init*

"Welcome to JobQuest! Before we search for jobs, let me set up your preferences. This takes just a minute."

*Asks location question*

**User:** "Remote and Dubai"

*Asks employment type*

**User:** "Full-time only"

*Creates configs*

"âœ… Setup complete! Now let me find jobs at Aktek for you..."

*Proceeds with jobquest-find-careers-url and jobquest-fetch-jobs*

---

**Important:** This skill should run **automatically** before any other jobquest skill if configs don't exist. Don't make users explicitly invoke it.
