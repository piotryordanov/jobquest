# Interview Prep

## Overview

This skill creates comprehensive interview preparation documents by analyzing job descriptions, predicting likely questions based on role requirements, and mapping the user's achievements to compelling answers. It generates prep materials saved to the communications folder for easy reference.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Says "prepare me for [company] interview"
- Asks "help me prep for interview with [person/company]"
- Mentions "I have an interview with [company] tomorrow/next week"
- Requests "create interview prep for [role]"
- References upcoming interview in timeline

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Job Application

1. Identify company and role from user's message
2. Find job application folder: `job_applications/{company}/{role}/`
3. Read `job-description.md` for role requirements
4. Read `timeline.yaml` to understand interview context (who, when, stage)

### Step 2: Analyze Role Requirements

Extract from job description:
- **Role type** (IC vs leadership, technical vs product, etc.)
- **Key responsibilities** (what they'll do day-to-day)
- **Required skills** (technical + soft skills)
- **Experience level** (seniority expectations)
- **Domain focus** (industry, technology, business area)
- **Company stage** (startup vs established - affects questions)

### Step 3: Identify Interview Type

Based on timeline and user input:
- **Recruiter screen** - Culture fit, basics, logistics
- **Hiring manager** - Role fit, experience deep-dive, team dynamics
- **Technical** - System design, coding, architecture
- **Executive** - Strategic thinking, leadership, business impact
- **Panel** - Mix of above, multiple perspectives

Tailor prep document to interview type.

### Step 4: Read User's Achievements

Read `bio/` folder focusing on relevant areas:
- `bio/introduction.mdx` - Overall background
- `bio/cto-leadership/*.mdx` - Leadership examples
- `bio/leadership/*.mdx` - Specific leadership scenarios
- Project folders matching job domain (ots-capital, tradebrix, etc.)

Extract:
- Specific accomplishments matching role requirements
- Metrics and outcomes
- Technical depth examples
- Leadership/collaboration stories
- Challenges overcome
- Domain expertise demonstrations

### Step 5: Generate Likely Questions

Based on role requirements and interview type, create questions in categories:

#### Technical Questions (for technical roles)
- Architecture/design questions
- Technology stack depth
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Trade-off discussions
- Performance/scale challenges

#### Experience Questions (all roles)
- "Tell me about a time when..."
- Past work deep-dives
- Specific achievements
- Role-relevant scenarios

#### Behavioral Questions
- Leadership and team dynamics
- Conflict resolution
- Prioritization and decision-making
- Handling failure/setbacks
- Cross-functional collaboration

#### Role-Specific Questions
- For PM: Product strategy, stakeholder management, roadmapping
- For CTO: Org design, technical strategy, team building
- For Engineer: Code quality, debugging, system design
- For Quant: Algorithm development, backtesting, risk management

### Step 6: Map Achievements to Answers

For each predicted question, identify which achievements provide strong answers.

**Format:**
```markdown
### Question: "Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult technical decision with limited information"

**Your Answer (from bio):**
- **Situation:** At OTS Capital, needed to choose deployment strategy (VPS vs K8s) for 6 business units
- **Challenge:** Limited budget, varied technical needs, tight timeline
- **Action:** Analyzed requirements per unit, prototyped both, measured trade-offs
- **Result:** Chose hybrid approach, saved $X/month, deployed in Y weeks
- **Source:** bio/cto-leadership/technical-decisions.mdx

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Decision framework used
- Stakeholder management across 6 units
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Execution speed

**Metrics to mention:**
- 50% cost reduction

- Timeline: 2 weeks
```

### Step 7: Create "Questions to Ask Them"

Generate thoughtful questions the user should ask, based on:
- Company stage and challenges
- Role responsibilities
- Team structure
- Technology decisions
- Growth opportunities

**Categories:**
- About the role and day-to-day

- About success metrics and expectations

### Step 8: Add Company/Role Research

Include brief section with:

- Key people interviewing with (if known from timeline)
- Company values or mission (if relevant)

### Step 9: Generate Prep Document

Create comprehensive prep doc at:

## Best Practices

### Question Prediction
1. **Focus on role requirements** - Don't generic-ize, tailor to JD
2. **Consider interview stage** - Early vs late rounds ask different questions
3. **Match interviewer** - Recruiter vs engineer vs exec ask different things
4. **Include 10-15 questions** - Enough to cover likely ground, not overwhelming

### Answer Mapping
1. **Be specific** - Point to exact achievements, not vague skills
2. **Include metrics** - Numbers make stories memorable
3. **Use STAR format** - Situation, Task, Action, Result
4. **Vary examples** - Don't reuse same project for every answer
5. **Match their language** - Use terminology from job description

### Questions to Ask
1. **Be genuine** - Only include questions user would actually ask
2. **Show depth** - Questions should demonstrate research/understanding
3. **Avoid basics** - Don't ask what's easily Googleable
4. **Be strategic** - Questions also sell your expertise
5. **Mix types** - Role, team, technical, company

### Document Length
- **Recruiter screen:** 2-3 pages (lighter prep)
- **Hiring manager:** 4-6 pages (comprehensive)
